# ProjectRawbubbl
Project: Rawbubbl, made by scanlators, for scanlators.

## Project: Rawbubbl is a tool that streamlines the scanlating process.
It includes all the tools any scanlator would ever need, including:
- Drawing tools, with editable brushes, sizes and more.
- Typesetting capabilities, with basic formatting
- Layering, masking, and lasso tools
- A built-in text editor with **automated translation features.**
- A text-bubble marking system to ease the typesetting process
- An automatic text and font recognition system.

**This may change depending on how easy it is to implement. I am not any genius, I am still learning.**
